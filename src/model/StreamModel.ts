/**
 * StreamState — the single source of truth for the streaming session.

 *
 * This owns *playback* only: how fast text is revealed, and whether it is
 * running. Parsing, reconciling, and rendering all belong to
 * `Markdown.createStream()`. The split matters because the controller's own
 * `pacing` option is fixed at construction and has no pause, while this demo's
 * whole point is a live rate slider and a pause button — so the controller is
 * created *without* pacing (pure animation-frame coalescing) and this state
 * decides what to hand it each frame.
